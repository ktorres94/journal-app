# Journal App – Project Outline

## Project Description
A basic Android journaling app that allows users to write and save personal entries. The goal is to offer a simple, easy-to-use interface for taking daily notes or reflections.

## Problem Addressing
People who want to keep a journal often struggle with remembering to write, losing their place, or not having a notebook with them. This app solves that by making journaling available on any Android phone.

## Platform
The app will be developed using Android Studio for the Android operating system. It will be built natively using Android’s default tools, with no third-party frameworks.

## Frontend / Backend Support
- **Frontend**: Built using XML in Android Studio. The app will have a home screen, a screen for writing entries, and one for reading them.
- **Backend**: Journal entries will be stored locally using internal device storage. Firebase may be explored in later phases, but the first version will work entirely offline.

## Functionality
- Create and save new journal entries
- View a list of stored entries
- Read individual entries
- Delete entries

## Wireframes
The app will include the following basic screens:
1. Home screen showing saved entries
2. Screen to create or edit an entry
3. Screen to read or delete an entry

Wireframes or sketches will be added later as development progresses.
